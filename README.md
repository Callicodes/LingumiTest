Technical Challenge #1 - Word Stickers


How does the algorithm work from a high-level perspective?

I decided on a forEach loop to loop through an array of words representing Word Stickers


Why did you choose to implement the algorithm in this way?

I gave myself an hour to do the test and wanted to demonstrate that I know how to loop through a list and return a string.

How could you improve/evolve the algorithm if given more time?

I would try to introduce more conditions to cover the rule guidelines:

Each returned string is the id for a Word provided in the first parameter
Each returned string should be unique (no repeats/duplicates)
The 3 strings can represent words that were not learned in that lesson
The 3 strings cannot represent words that have never been learned
The 3 strings can represent words that that they have already collected as a Word Sticker
There are no guarantees about the input (beyond type)
If the above criteria can be met, it must return exactly 3 strings
If the above criteria cannot be met, the function should erro

Running a test case.
